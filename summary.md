# **GREENSOL DATA SCIENCE INTERN ASSESSMENT REPORT**
---

### **Assumption(s) made**: 
- I assumed the *transaction_date* to be the date the user made the payment or transaction.
- I assumed the *due_date* to be the date when the payment was expected.

### **Challenges encountered**:
- I faced the challenge of understanding the context of some features - a metadata would have helped eliminate this.

### **Improvements if going to production**:
- I would suggest more data - to help generalize better.
- I would suggest a machine learning model rather than a scoring - a machine learning model would be able to learn more patterns in the dataset.
